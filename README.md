# sh0tstar474.github.io

This is my personal portfolio website showcasing my work in game development, web apps, and design.

How it works:

- I built this from scratch using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. No heavy frameworks, just clean code.

It features:

- Physics-based UI: Magnetic buttons and a custom cursor.

- Procedural Audio: Real-time sound effects generated by code (Web Audio API).

- Smooth Scrolling: Implemented with Lenis for a premium feel.

Feel free to look around the code!
